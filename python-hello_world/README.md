# python-hello_world

This directory contains simple Python scripts that are meant to provide a better understanding of the high-level programming language Python.  This directory contains simple scripts that use common Python functions like `print` and `import` to get familiar with them.

This project was meant to get me familiar with the syntax used in Python and get me to start seeing the differences when coding in Python rather than the previous programming language I used. (C)  This project is meant to be solely for my own educational purposes.
## Concepts Learned
